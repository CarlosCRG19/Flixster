# Project 2 - *Name of App Here*

**Name of your app** shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total (5 hours on basic requirements, 8 hours on bonus stories)

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [x] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [x] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Landscape mode is forced when video is played
* [x] The play button is only shown when the movie has a YouTube video. If there is no such video, the visibility of the button is changed.
* [x] Some items have transitions during the activity change.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Access the keys of the APIs in the different documents. There always has to be a defined context to access the resource files.
* Understanding the concept of Intents and how with these we can pass data between activities
* GET Request to get the video id. I was trying to create and return a variable in an inner class. I got help from Ellen and she explained that this is not possible, however the inner class could modify a value of the outer class.
* I think my implementation of the GET Request for the video ID was not the best. I decided to generate a field inside the Movie class and initialize it through a private method (which executes the Get Request). However, since the request is asynchronous, the user may request the movie details even when a response has not been received (so the id would be null)

## Additional features ideas for the future

* I would like to obtain information on other kinds of movies such as TopRated. Thus, I think it is possible to implement some component as a TabLayout where each fragment would represent one of the classifications.
* Include night mode. Use a component switch to change referenced values in Resource files
* Add the genres below the main photo in the detail activity through some component such as Chips (and a ChipGroup).
